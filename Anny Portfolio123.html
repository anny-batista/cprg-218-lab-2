            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi, I'm Anny Batista, a second-year student of the NMPD program. My passion lies in creating visual art, with vectorization being my favorite method of expression. I enjoy exploring various artistic techniques and experimenting with different mediums to bring my ideas to life. Art has always been a central part of my life, fueling my creativity and allowing me to express myself in unique ways. Outside of my artistic pursuits, I find joy in immersing myself in nature, capturing its beauty through photography, and delving into the pages of captivating books. Each day brings new inspiration and opportunities for artistic exploration, and I'm excited to continue growing as an artist and discovering new avenues for creative expression.</p>
